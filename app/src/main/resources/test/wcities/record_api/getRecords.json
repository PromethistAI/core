The only painting I knew of and wanted to see was \"SunFlowers\". Even I knew of this painting and I know nothing about art. We follow the map into the room where this masterpiece is kept. I walk up to area it is kept and look up at empty wall, with a small sign saying it was on tour. The gift shop had sun flowers everywhere, so that is where I had to see it. Maybe next time I will catch it. So if your are interest in only seeing a a certain painting, I would call ahead and see if it is there. Since it was free it was no big deal, but If I had to pay, it would have been a different story. Worth the free trip and it is right near the start of the walking tours offered by the Big Bus Company."
